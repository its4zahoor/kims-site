                nurses and other healthcare professionals in delivering basic
                patient care. Throughout the program, students learn about
                patient hygiene, vital signs monitoring, mobility assistance,
                and infection control procedures. They also receive training in
                communication skills and patient interaction. Upon completion of
                the program and passing a competency exam, graduates become
                certified nursing assistants, eligible for employment in various
                healthcare settings such as nursing homes, hospitals, and home
                care agencies. CNAs play a vital role in providing essential

                The Community Midwifery (CMW) program trains students to provide
                essential maternal and newborn care within community settings.
                Students learn about prenatal care, childbirth assistance,
                postpartum support, and newborn care techniques. Through a
                combination of classroom instruction and hands-on clinical
                experience, students develop skills in conducting routine
                prenatal assessments, assisting with labor and delivery, and
                providing education and support to expectant mothers and their
                families. Graduates of the CMW program play a crucial role in

                underserved communities where access to healthcare services may
                be limited. They serve as advocates for maternal and newborn
                well-being, empowering families to make informed decisions and
